       IRCIT 0.3.1 - IRC client for the Information Terrorists!




       IRCIT is a new, non-derivative IRC client catering for the
       needs  of  the  non-average user.  It  currently	 runs  on
       Linux-based  systems   and   will   not	 compile  without
       modifications by non-GNUC-compatible compilers.

       IRCIT  is  not a ``yet another IRC client'' sort of thing.
       It's a clean departure from whatever currently  exists  in
       the  text-mode  category	 of UNIX IRC clients and is being
       geared with features that will appeal to people with sense
       of  sophistication.   IRCIT  is part of a  more	ambitious
       project,	 ultimately  aiming  at supporting    wide   col-
       lection	of  Internet-mediated  communication modules, and
       providing    both   ``proprietary''   and     conventional
       communication  channels	for  the  so dubbed ``Information
       Terrorists''.  So  what you see now is really  a	 snapshot
       of work in progress.


WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE
       It's been a while since I released new revisions; in fact,
       it wasn't my intention at all to release any revisions  in
       the  0.3	 series,  but  since  some major redesign work is
       undergoing, I envisioned I'd release  some  revisions   in
       the   0.3   series   before  I  finish  the  changes  that
       will eventually lead to	the  birth  of	0.4,  which  will
       include,	 among	other  things,	visual toolkit for script
       writing. Consequently, the quality of changes  present  in
       this  revision	is   not   substantial;	 mainly	 cosmetic
       and  corrective.

       I've generated some  screen-shots  for  IRCIT  using  ANSI
       sequenses.  I find them impressive and quite nice. You can
       generate similar files using the /SCREENSHOT command,  but
       unfortunately,  I  haven't  included the program needed to
       process these files--I will in some future release.

       Thank-you to all users, who sent e-mails, or left notes at
       my  webpage, enquerying about the current standing of  the
       devolepment,  because  they  thought  it	 has  halted   or
       something.   I  have to admit, I have small time-quota for
       IRCIT, but I try to utilize it in the most effective  way.

       I  hope	you  find  this	 release  more	useable	 than the
       previous one.  For  more	 specific  details  on	the   new
       features in this release, consult the NNEEWWSS file in the doc
       directory.


FINALE
       Please  skim through ircit.help, it  has	 some  documented
       commands and it will help you understand the basic  syntax
       of  IRCIT,  it will  particularly help you appreciate  the
       potentials  of  IRCIT.  I've also written a man page which
       explains the command-line  arguments   and  various  other
       things. Please read that, too.

       My   TO-DO  list	 is  quite  exhaustive,	 but I don't mind
       adding some of yours, too! Espacially the unusual features
       that  you always considered necessary in the IRC enviromet
       (try to avoid war stuff).  If you feel you have	something
       sensible	  to   say regarding  this softwar or myself, you
       are encouraged to write to me about it. Also, If you in	a
       position	 to  host  a  mailing-list for IRCIT on your sys-
       tem, I'd love to hear from you. To  recieve  notifications
       about  new  releases,   visit  IRCIT's  modest webpage and
       register	 a  functional e-mail address.
	And  finally, If you wish to  send  corrections	 or  con-
       tribute	code,  you must send diff-patches and you need to
       observe my indentation rules. If your contribution is vast
       and spans multible files, you need to document it.
