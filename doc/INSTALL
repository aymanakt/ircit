 Notes for upgraders:
----------------------

       "make install" will not create the $HOME/.ircit directory if
       it's already there, and no files will be updated.

       You are strongly encourged to look at the ircit.fpl file
       because it always contains new stuff and examples.

       If Upgrading to 0.3.1, update your copy of ircit.conf and
       ircit.fpl by copying the ones that come with package. You can
       append your changes to the new files. This is necessary because
       I changed the semantics of the Alias() function. If you've got
       your own defined aliases, an extra parameter, of type string, is
       necessary or your aliases will fail.
       E.g. suppose you've defined the following:
       alias ("Hello", "say(\"Hello, World\");");
       then you'll have to modify it to read:
       alias ("Hello", "say(\"Hello, World\");", "");
       The last param is a help string, but it can be empty.

 INSTALLATION:
---------------

       No special magic; perform these simple operations:

  ---------------------------------
   If you are building from soure:
  ---------------------------------
          - configure
            you can check the ./src/Makefile for possible tweakings
            if you want.

          - make
            There should be no errors, ignore any warnings.
            A binary in ./bin will be created.

          - make install
            Will create, if necessary, $HOME/.ircit directory to hold
            ircit's config file and a standard script file, in which
            common aliases are defined. The binary file is not copied anywhere;
            copy it to your favourite binary dir. 
            The script file is not needed, but it will be processed if
            present. You can load your own files via /LOAD.
            
            You are strongly encourged to look at the ircit.fpl file
            because it always contains new stuff and examples.

          - Thats it!

          - You may want to edit to config file to reflect your settings.
            There's one SET variable, IPC_PATH, which you will need to set
            for example: IPC_PATH /home/ayman/.ircit/ipc
            replace ``/home/ayman'' with your $HOME.


  ------------------------------------------
   If you are running a pre-compiled binary:
  ------------------------------------------
        - copy the "bin/ircit" file to your favourite location.
        - Create the $HOME/.ircit/ directory if not already present and
          copy ircit.conf and ircit.fpl from the package's etc directory
          to there. See the section above about "make install".


        - Try not to ignore the accompanied documentation.

        - You are now ready to run ircit.
