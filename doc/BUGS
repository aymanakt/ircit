 Notes:
  -*- When reporting bugs, basic information about your system can sometimes
      aid in debugging. Include things like your kernel version and
      distribution if known. Your ncurses version.
      Please remember IRCIT doesn't run well under xterm.

  -*- I will not look into curses-related problems if your ncurses is
      not 4.0 or higher. I discovered that older ncurses implementations
      (slackware 3.5 and debian 2.0 ship with these) will not display 
      dialogboxes and msgboxes correctly. To find out about your existing
      ncurses version, type the following command (exactly as shown) 
      at the shell prompt:
      grep "#define NCURSES_VERSION " /usr/include/ncurses.h | awk '{print $3}'

  -*- If some entry is described as disabled, this usually means the actual
      code, or an hook of some sort does exist for it, but it's been turned
      off for this release.

  -*- If your IRCIT crashes, try to send me the output of gdb on the generated
      core file.
      The easiest way to get that output is to type (after the crash):
      gdb ircit core
      then type:
      where
      Thats it! cut&paste, send it to me.




 - I've just realized EXEC is broken (v0.3). Sorry.

 - SET TMP_DIR isn't enabled, it defaults to /tmp. All your dcc get files
   go there.

 - DCC SEND doesn't stick well to the standard DCC protocol, current 
   implementation _can_ send incomplete files. Fortunately this only happens
   under exceptional conditions (unusually bad link to the Internet..)

 - DCC REJECT isn't handled properly yet.

 - DCC timeout is not enabled in this release.

 - Telnet timeout is not enabled in this release.

 - Flood control isn't enabled in this release. Not even when we output to 
   server. This may result in having your connection closed if you apply some
   mass-action: mass-op, mass-kick...I haven't tried it myself though.

 - There's an occasional, hard-to-reproduce bug associated with the EXEC
   command. I think this will go when I employ sensible thread support other
   than the current one.

 - Colors connot be saved from within IRCIT without saving the whole
   set of preferences, which isn't exactly desirable thing. Save your
   color settings manually until I fix this. This isn't really bug.

 - WHO command isn't handled properly yet.

 - Do expect stupid results or ambiguous messages.

 - IRCIT isn't exactly xterm-friendly (or any xshell for that matter).
   I have no serious plans for supporting it.
