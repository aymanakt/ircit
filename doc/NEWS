 IRCIT 0.3.1 20AUG98

 ------------------------------
  NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCEMENTS:
 ------------------------------
 - The top-most window (the active window), has different corner
   decoration to make it stand out from the rest.
 - Intruduced new semantics for window-movement. In order to move a window,
   you'll need to press CTRL-V. A special visual feedback will confirm this
   change. Use the arrow-keys to move it around, or vi-style keys: l-k-h-j.
   Any other key will terminate this mode.
 - Introduced shortcuts in menubar and menuboxes. Also added new semantics
   for menubar/box navigation: you can use numbers to jump to the desired
   entry.
 - Many visual effects like animated window-poups and closures. Menubar will
   blink if reactivated. I also introduced some delays to emphasize these
   effects, otherwise they'd look like flickering on faster machines. This's
   not user-controlable yet.
 - User-defined aliases can include help string. It will be integrated with
   the on-line help facility.
   

 ------------------
  BUG FIXES:
 ------------------
 - Fixed important bug with alias expansion. Imbeded quote characters,
   '"', when used in arguments to an alias, would confuse the fpl interpreter. 
 - Cursor will not show up after the client resumed running in the foreground.
   (as a result of CTRL-Z action)
 - Fixed cursor-visibility in Dialogboxes - not exactly perfect fix, though.
 - Fixed the "Sorry, i need to be fixed first" error message generated when
   an entry in the Help scrolling list is selected.

 IRCIT 0.3  16JUN98

 ------------------------------
  NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCMENTS:
 ------------------------------
 - Added limited ket-binding facility. Limited only in the sense that small
   set of keys can be bound, but _not_ in what they could be bound to.
   Current implementation allows for the binding of Function Keys, F1-F22.
 - New set variable AUTO_HOLD_MODE. When set, IRCIT will be automatically
   set the HOLD_MODE variable ON whenever the main window is unavailable
   for displaying data (i.e. when GUI is used). When OFF, the output is 
   flushed through the lower status window.
 - Added Last Log facility. It allows finer control on what to keep in 
   Last Log, and can be set seperately for each channel. Check out the new
   /LASTLOG command and the new LAST_LOG set-variable.
 - Added new switch to the CHANNELS command, -LOG. Displays Last Log settings
   for channels.
 - Rewrote the HISTORY command. It's now possible to save/load history files.
   You can even PLAY history files, whereby they'll be treated as if they 
   were typed in the program. Please read the entry for HISTORY in 
   ircit.help file. Also related to this facility the new set-variable 
   HISTORY_DIR.
 - The quality of the documentation has improved. A seperate directory, 
   programming, in the doc directory was created with many files concerned
   with script-writing.
 - Many little enhancements and consistency checks.

 ------------------
  BUG FIXES:
 ------------------
 - I haven't touched the GUI system for this release. So any reported bugs
   will probably remain outstanding.
 - Many little fixes and enhancments.

 IRCIT 0.2  22MAY98

 ------------------------------
  NEW FEATURES AND ENHANCMENTS:
 ------------------------------
 - Added scripting support!
   99% C-like syntax language was incorporated into IRCIT.
 - /ALIAS command was added with sophisticated set of support-macros.
 - /HELP command was added. Neatly prints the syntax. Also in the process
    of removing the -h switch from all the commands - use /HELP instead. 
 - /FPL command was added. Command-line interface to the interpreter.
 - /LOAD command was added. Loads files into the interpreter.
 - Improved completion facility. It's now faster and displays all possible
   completions even your aliases!
 - You can use the completion facility to complete the /HELP command arguments. 
 - Some changes in the syntax; `*' should be used now instead of `*.*'
   but you can escape `*' with `\' to get the literal meaning.
   e.g. instead of: ``/ignore -*.*'' you can say ``/ignore -*''
   if you have `*' as valid entry, then you'll need to escape it in the
   command: ``/ignor -\*''. Note: not all commands have been converted to
   this format yet.
 - A posted window will be automatically killed if it's data ceases to exist
   (in a truely dramaic way!). To try this, join couple of dummy channels, 
   get window posted for each channel (thru menu) then cover them with
   other windows (eg servers, timers, help, about...) now type /quit followed
   by ``Insert'' key (if you press enter, the active window will catch it
   and something else will take place).
 - Added GUI interface to IRC's /OPER command in form of dialog-box. 
 - Windows can be moved around. Internally its fully implemented, but no 
   standard key-bindings are assigned yet, as a result, dialog-boxes cannot be 
   moved, but most other windows will (use vi-style keys: j-k-l-h).
 - CTRL-X can be used to switch between the two top-most posted windows.
 - More intelligent Servers List management. Redundant or duplicate entries
   will be removed when discovered. For example, entries that map to the same IP
   number will be removed.
 - Enabled flood-control in telnet logins and traffic. This area still
   under-devolopped.
 - Added -SOCK and -TEL to the EXEC command. You can now redirect output
   to sockets, or people on your Telnet service.
 - Added new SET variable, COMMAND_CHAR. Notice you'll no longer be able to
   enter commands if you disable this, except for text to channels or DCC or via
   the menu.
 - Added new SET variable, AUTO_SHOW_OPTMENU. Option menu associated with a list   will automatically show-up if set.
 - F2 will show list of possible actions instead of automatically issuing 
   /WHOIS.
 - CTRL-U now kills the whole line - suggested by Ananth.

 ------------------
  BUG FIXES:
 ------------------
 - The mysterious, unpredictable disappearance of the currently active 
   window appears to be fixed.
 - STICKY_MENU and STICKY_LISTS appear to be working correctly now.
   You can stack the desktop with as many windows as you want and switch
   between them however way you want.
 - Temporarily-disabled menu choices are ``greyed'' correctly now. True
   context-sensetivity!
 - A specially nasty bug that was trashing the windows stack has been
   traced and dealt with appropriately.
 - Fixed cursor movements with CTRl-K (forward kill).
 - Many little fixes and enhancments.
